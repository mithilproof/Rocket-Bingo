<h1>Fantastic End Of The World</h1>
<h4>It's the end of the world, and it's going to be absolutely fantastic.</h4>

<p>Hans JÃ¼rgen, the evil mastermind, has almost achieved her goal of obliterating earth. The earth will be entirely nuked in approximately 42 minutes.</p>

<p>(Due to time and space constraints, we do not elaborate on the ulterior motives behind this endeavour.)</p>

<p>However, there would still be plenty leftover nuclear weapons. After all, the Cold War has not been won by playing child games!</p>

<p>In this game, you are not playing as the evil mastermind, but as a subcontractor. Your job is to dispose of the leftover weapons by shooting them into space and detonating them at predefined positions in the night sky, in order to create a spectacular, splendid, yuuuge fireworks display for everyone to watch in their final moments and also accompanying the obliteration itself. Going down with style, so to speak.</p>

<p>However, capitalism demands that there be competition. A rival subcontractor has been given the same task as you, and thus only the one who disposes of more fireworks has a chance to survive.</p>

<p>And as if that wouldn't be enough to worry about already, the Russians may have noticed that you have learned counting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfjHJneVonE" target="_blank">in a way they do not particularly like</a>.</p>

<h2>How to play</h2>

<p>Hit the targets of your own color (yellow) with your rockets. Wonderful explosions will be your reward. You also get one point for each target you hit.</p>
<p>If your rocket gets destroyed or hits a target, a new one is launched instantly from your rocket launcher in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>A rocket gets destroyed if it tries to escape the screen. We want our audience to see the beautiful explosions!</p>
<p>A rocket gets destroyed if it collides with another rocket. If you hit the other player's rocket (cyan), both of you lose all their points!</p>
<p>The russians don't care about screen borders.</p>
<p>The game ends when a player has accumulated more than 10 points (that is at least 11 points). That player is also the winner of the game.</p>
